# Unit Testing

* Unit testing helps you discover bugs before they become bugs. The act of thinking through how to test your code will uncover silly and stupid programming errors.
* Unit testing forces you to think through edge cases that are difficult for some to think through when you're just trying to get something to work.
* Unit tests are the* best documentation you could write. When well written, a unit test describes how code works. It also requires update when behavior changes, so it'll never be out of date; when it's not accurate, it'll break your build.
* Unit testing encourages better design. Knowing you need to write a unit test will force design considerations that otherwise take years of experience to realize. This can be a double-edge sword though, as I've seen bad design lead to worse design when unit tests are forced onto terrible existing code (i.e.: "I'll just make this thing public so I can access it from my test.")
* Most importantly, unit testing provides a very important safety net for you. If you want to add a feature, refactor some code or hand your app off to another maintainer, there's a very clear signal if something breaks and the broken unit test will tell you where it's broken and how it's supposed to work.
